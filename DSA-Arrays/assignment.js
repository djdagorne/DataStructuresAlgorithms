//pushing these values would give a length of 6, capacity of 18, and a memory address of 

// popping three times would reduce the array by 3 units, which in turn would reduce its memory consumption by 9, 
    //it would also run quite a few more operations than if you were to just do a single pop command that popped 3 units.
    //instead it has to calculate its memory allocation 3 seperate times, as well as copy and reallocate 

//URLifying a string would be as simple as using a for loop to create a new string letter by letter, a linear BigO size, but when str[i]===' ', push %20 to the string instead.

//this would be a for loop comparing to the number 5, so another linear operation effeciency, dropping numbers that are greater than 5.

//this question isn't really phrased in an accurate way, but I assume you keep track of currentSum and maximumSum, and when currentSum > maxSum, make currentSum = maxSum.
    // and note the index that takes place at continue through a for loop, keeping track of currentSum and updating maxSum when necessary. 

// one while loop comparing the arrays digit by digit. i and j representing the index's of the arrays.
    //if the secondaryvalue[j] > primaryvalue[i], newArray.push(primaryvalue[i])
    //if the secondaryvalue[j] =< primaryvalue[i], newArray.push(secondaryvalue[i])
    //once one loop exceeds the length of one of the arrays, push the remaining array to the end of the newArray

//create a new string letter by letter using two for loops to compare each letter of the first string to each letter of the second string.
    //if the first string's letter is not found to be similar to any letters in the second string, add it to the new string. proceed in order.
    //this is an exponential compute time with the more letters added to the secondary 'filtering' String.
